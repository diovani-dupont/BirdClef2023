BirdCLEF
==============================

The following code is a script developed for Kaggle's BirdCLEEF 2023 competition, it is a machine learning script that processes, trains and evaluates an audio classification model, based on features extracted from audio files. It uses the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to train a model that identifies birdsong in audio recordings.
